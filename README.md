# mypod

## Getting Started

This project is a simple example of how to use Serverpod.

A great starting point for learning Serverpod is our documentation site at:
[https://docs.serverpod.dev](https://docs.serverpod.dev).

To run the project, go to the `mypod_server` folder and follow the instructions in the `README.md` file there.

Once the server is running, go to the `mypod_flutter` you can start the Flutter app with:

    flutter run
